# Question  
What are the four main goals of the TLS protocol?
# Answer
1. Crypthographic security - Third parties shall not be able to read the transported data.  
2. Interoperability - Programs written for different systems by different programmers shall be able to communicate.  
3. Extensibility - The protcol shall be able to be modified without having to use an entirely new protocol should weaknesses be discovered in the building blocks of the protocol. Or if it is just decided that a higher level of security shall be used at a late stage in a project.  
4. Efficiency - The protocol can not be allowed to cause too much performance loss in a system.
